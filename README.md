# HYSCORE_14N_simulation
MATLAB script for simulation of 14N HYSCORE Spectrum
This script simulates and plots HYSCORE EPR spectra at different field positions. It uses the Easy-spin package (https://easyspin.org/) for MATLAB which should be installed to make the script run. 
The script can be easily adapted for the simulation of other frequencies.
